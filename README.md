# PacManAI

The following script is an implementation of a basic game in Pac-Man style. It demonstrates the use of classic AI as
the controller of the agent _(Pac-Man)_ of the game, and it tries to find the shortest path to the food (the goal) by
only knowing its own sequence of actions and positions; meaning it __can't "see" the surroundings__ unless it tries
to move to them.
